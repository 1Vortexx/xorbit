    <h1>X-ORBIT Proxy Services Privacy Policy Agreement</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how X-ORBIT Proxy Services ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal information when you use our services, including proxy access, browsing tools, and any other related services we provide. By interacting with our platform or using any of our products, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect both personal and non-personal data to provide and improve our services. The personal data you may provide includes your full name, email address, payment details, and account information related to your use of our proxy systems. If you fill out a form, create an account, or make a purchase, we will store the data you input for internal use.</p>

    <p>Additionally, we automatically collect data regarding your usage of our proxy services. This includes connection logs, session times, bandwidth usage, and IP addresses. We may also use cookies and tracking tools to better understand how you interact with our websites and proxies, so we can improve performance and security.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used to operate, maintain, and enhance our offerings. We use your data to authenticate users, ensure secure proxy connections, process transactions, and improve overall service reliability. Internally, this helps us monitor system performance and prevent misuse of our services.</p>

    <p>We may also use your contact information to send you important notifications, system updates, or promotional materials (only if you have opted in). If you apply for specialized access or roles within our platform, your data may be reviewed by our internal team and stored for administrative purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>Your data is never sold. However, we may share it with trusted third-party vendors who assist in providing services such as payment processing, hosting infrastructure, or analytics. These partners are required to keep your data secure and confidential.</p>

    <p>We may also disclose information if legally required to do so, or if necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, protect our network, or respond to legal processes. This may include cooperating with law enforcement agencies, handling disputes, or safeguarding the integrity of our platform.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement strong security measures to protect your information. Sensitive data is encrypted, and access is strictly limited to authorized personnel. We conduct regular audits and updates to defend against unauthorized access, breaches, or other vulnerabilities.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide the services you have requested. If you terminate your use of our proxies, we may still keep limited records to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes. Users may request complete deletion of their data, unless restricted by law or policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or request deletion of your personal data held by X-ORBIT Proxy Services. You may also object to certain processing activities or request limitations on how your data is used. To exercise these rights, please contact us directly at the support link below.</p>

    <h2>7. Minors and Age Restrictions</h2>
    <p>We do not knowingly collect data from users under the age of 13. If we discover that we have unintentionally stored data from a user under this age, we will remove such information immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. International Users</h2>
    <p>If you are accessing our services from outside your country of residence, your data may be transferred to and processed in countries with different privacy laws. We apply safeguards to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on our official website, and you will be notified if we change anything. You are encouraged to review the updated version periodically. Continued use of our services constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
