    <h1>X-ORBIT Proxy Services Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 09/10/25</p>
    <p>Welcome to X-ORBIT Proxy Services! By using our services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please discontinue use of our services.</p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Proxy and Network Services</h3>
    <p>X-ORBIT provides proxy services, secure browsing tools, and related network access. The specific services you subscribe to will be detailed in your service plan. Clients receive login credentials or access tokens required to use the proxy systems, and the sharing of access credentials with unauthorized parties is strictly prohibited. While we strive for maximum uptime, occasional downtime may occur due to maintenance, upgrades, or unexpected technical issues. As part of your service, you will receive a secure proxy connection, an account dashboard and management portal, usage documentation, and optional add-ons such as rotating IPs or advanced security filters.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Service Modifications</h3>
    <p>Any modifications to your subscribed services must be formally requested and may incur additional fees. All requested modifications must be approved before implementation to ensure compliance with system requirements and security protocols.</p>

    <h2>2. Ownership and Rights</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
    <p>All intellectual property, including but not limited to software, systems, and documentation, belongs to X-ORBIT Proxy Services. Clients are granted a limited, non-transferable license to use the services for personal or business purposes during the term of this Agreement.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Service Provider Rights</h3>
    <p>X-ORBIT retains the right to manage network settings and performance to maintain stability and security. We also reserve the right to restrict or terminate activity deemed abusive, illegal, or harmful to our network and users.</p>

    <p class="notice">For more details on data collection, please refer to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Usage and Limitations</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p>Clients must not use the services for unlawful purposes, including hacking, fraud, or distribution of malicious software. High-bandwidth abuse, spamming, or activities that disrupt the network are strictly prohibited and may lead to immediate suspension of services.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Service Actions</h3>
    <p>X-ORBIT may take necessary actions, including suspension or termination, if a client is found violating these Terms. We may also throttle or limit usage in cases of excessive strain on the network to ensure fair access for all users.</p>

    <h2>4. Compensation</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Fees & Payment</h3>
    <p>Clients agree to pay fees associated with their selected plan, with payment required in advance unless otherwise agreed upon. Failure to make timely payments may result in service suspension or account termination until the outstanding balance is settled.</p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Mutual Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>Both parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information, including account details and service configurations, and must take reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Non-Disclosure</h3>
    <p>Confidential information cannot be shared with third parties without prior written consent, except as required by law or regulatory authorities.</p>

    <h2>6. Term & Termination</h2>
    <p>This Agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party. Either party may terminate the Agreement with a 24-hour notice, provided all outstanding payments are fulfilled.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>X-ORBIT is not liable for damages, including downtime, data loss, or indirect financial impacts. Clients agree to indemnify and hold harmless X-ORBIT Proxy Services from claims arising out of misuse of the service.</p>

    <h2>8. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, the remaining provisions shall remain enforceable and continue to govern the relationship between both parties.</p>

    <h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of X-ORBIT's operating jurisdiction. Any disputes will be resolved through arbitration or mediation as deemed appropriate by X-ORBIT.</p>
